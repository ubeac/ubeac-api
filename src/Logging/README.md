## Logging Packages
As you know, logging is one of the most important topics in software development. Therefore, implementing it correctly can help you a lot in the debugging process. At uBeac we have logging packages implemented based on real-world scenarios. You can easily implement an advanced logging system using uBeac packages.

- [uBeac.Web.Logging](uBeac.Web.Logging): Using this package you can implement HTTP request/response logging.
- [uBeac.Web.Logging.MongoDB](uBeac.Web.Logging.MongoDB): Using this package you can store HTTP request/response logs in MongoDB.
