## Common Packages
It may happen to you that in your projects you have a series of common modules that are the same in all parts of the project, in such cases we usually create a new folder or project and put these modules inside it. We made it easy for you. Most of the common needs that exist in different .NET projects are implemented in uBeac common packages and you can use them as needed.

- [uBeac.Common](https://github.com/ubeac/ubeac-api/tree/main/src/Common/uBeac.Core.Common): This package includes base entities, models, interfaces and etc. that are required in all .NET projects. You no longer need to waste time on repetitive things.
- [uBeac.Configuration](https://github.com/ubeac/ubeac-api/tree/main/src/Common/uBeac.Core.Configuration): This package with its simple and attractive solution helps you to organize your JSON configuration files, If you emphasize the cleanliness of the project structure then you should see this.

Let's go!
