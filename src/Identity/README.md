## Identity Packages
Identity management (authorization/authentication/user management) is one of the most important parts of any software. Implementing this is time consuming. Since identity management is implemented in most projects in the same way, it can be implemented as a standalone module and used in all projects. At uBeac we do this for you based on real-world scenarios.

- [uBeac.Identity.Common](uBeac.Core.Identity.Common): Includes base entities, models, options and repository interfaces.
- [uBeac.Identity.MongoDB](uBeac.Core.Identity.MongoDB): Implements repositories in MongoDB.
- [uBeac.Identity](uBeac.Core.Identity): Provides identity management services.
- [uBeac.Identity.Jwt](uBeac.Core.Identity.Jwt): Provides JWT service.

Let's go!
